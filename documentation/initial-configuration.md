# Initial configuration

After successfully booting DecriptOS for the first time, there are some key configurations you might want to undertake to ensure your system is secure and ready to interact with the web3 ecosystem.

**Security Configuration**

Securing your DecriptOS system is crucial to protect your digital assets and personal data. Follow these steps to enhance your system's security:

* **Firewall Setup**: DecriptOS comes with a pre-configured firewall, but you might want to review its settings based on your specific needs. Access the firewall settings through the terminal or the security settings panel and ensure it's activated and configured to block unauthorized inbound connections.
* **Antivirus Installation**: While DecriptOS is designed with security in mind, installing an antivirus can provide an additional layer of protection. You can install ClamAV, a free and open-source antivirus engine, from the software center or via the terminal using the command `sudo apt-get install clamav`.
* **Regular Updates**: Keeping your system updated is vital for security. Regularly check for updates for your operating system and installed applications. Use the DecriptOS manager for system updates and the software center for application updates.
* **Data Encryption**: Consider encrypting sensitive files or even your entire home directory. Tools like VeraCrypt can be used to create encrypted volumes, while DecriptOS also includes utilities for full-disk encryption.

**Web3 Wallet Configuration**

Setting up a secure web3 wallet on DecriptOS is straightforward, thanks to its pre-installed tools and applications designed for blockchain and cryptocurrency operations.

* **Choose a Wallet**: DecriptOS comes with several pre-installed wallets like Electrum, Exodus, and more. Decide which wallet best suits your needs based on the cryptocurrencies you plan to use and the features you require.
* **Create a New Wallet**: Launch your chosen wallet application from the menu. If it's your first time using the wallet, select the option to create a new wallet. Follow the on-screen instructions, which typically involve setting a strong password and backing up your recovery phrase.
* **Secure Your Recovery Phrase**: The recovery phrase is a critical component of your wallet's security. Write it down on a piece of paper and store it in a safe place. Never store your recovery phrase digitally or share it with anyone.
* **Test the Wallet**: Before transferring significant amounts of cryptocurrency to your new wallet, perform a test transaction with a small amount. This ensures that everything is set up correctly and that you're comfortable using the wallet.

By following these initial configuration steps, you'll enhance the security of your DecriptOS system and set up a secure environment for your web3 activities. Remember, the security of your digital assets largely depends on the precautions you take and your ongoing vigilance.
